## Ethical Boundaries and System Limitations

The Academic Grievance Decision Support System operates within the following **explicit ethical boundaries**:

### What the System Does NOT Do

1. **Does NOT replace grievance committees**: The system provides decision recommendations and regulatory citations. Final authority rests with human committees.

2. **Does NOT adjudicate discretionary cases**: Cases flagged as ambiguous (containing "may," "exceptional circumstances," etc.) are escalated to human review without automated recommendations.

3. **Does NOT override institutional authority**: The system respects hierarchical governance (L1 > L2 > L3) and defers to human judgment in all boundary cases.

4. **Does NOT make autonomous decisions**: All system outputs are recommendations, not binding decisions. Human oversight is mandatory.

5. **Does NOT claim legal validity**: System recommendations are based on rule interpretation, not legal advice. Institutional legal counsel should be consulted for complex cases.

### What the System DOES Do

1. **Supports human decision-making**: Provides regulatory citations, threshold checks, and decision traces to assist committees.

2. **Ensures consistency**: Applies rules uniformly across all cases, reducing arbitrary variation.

3. **Improves transparency**: Generates complete decision traces showing which rules were applied and why.

4. **Flags edge cases**: Identifies boundary conditions, conflicts, and ambiguities requiring human judgment.

5. **Monitors fairness**: Tracks decision patterns across demographic groups to detect potential disparities.

### Governance Alignment

The system is designed as **assistive governance technology**, not autonomous adjudication. It aligns with principles of:

- **Procedural justice**: Transparent, consistent, and explainable processes
- **Human accountability**: Final decisions made by accountable human authorities
- **Institutional autonomy**: Respects university self-governance and policy-making authority
- **Student rights**: Preserves right to appeal, human review, and contextual judgment
