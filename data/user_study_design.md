# User Study: Impact of Explainability on Student Trust

## Study Design

### Research Question
Does providing rule-based explanations alongside grievance decisions improve students' perceived fairness, trust, and transparency, independent of decision outcome?

### Participants
- **N = 40 students**
- Mixed academic programs (BTech, MSc, MBA, BBA)
- Mixed academic levels (1st year to 4th year)
- No requirement for actual grievance experience
- Recruited from university campus with informed consent

### Experimental Design
**Within-subjects A/B study** (counterbalanced)

Each participant evaluates the **same grievance scenario** under two conditions:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **A: Decision Only** | Outcome presented without explanation |
| **B: Decision + Explanation** | Outcome presented with rule-based explanation (regulation citation, threshold, rationale) |

**Counterbalancing:** 
- Group 1 (n=20): Sees Condition A first, then Condition B
- Group 2 (n=20): Sees Condition B first, then Condition A

This controls for order effects.

### Stimuli

**Scenario 1: Attendance Shortage**

**Condition A (Decision Only):**
```
Grievance Status: REJECTED

Your attendance grievance has been rejected.
```

**Condition B (Decision + Explanation):**
```
Grievance Status: REJECTED

Your attendance grievance has been rejected.

Explanation:
- Applicable Regulation: UGC Regulation 2018, Section 4.2
- Requirement: Minimum 75% attendance for semester examination eligibility
- Your Attendance: 72%
- Medical Exception: Applies only when attendance is ≥65% AND valid medical 
  certificate from recognized authority is submitted within 7 days of absence
- Your Situation: Medical certificate submitted 12 days after absence period
- Decision Rationale: Medical exception criteria not met due to late submission

Regulatory Authority: L1 (National - UGC)
Rule Salience: 1500 (High Priority)
```

**Scenario 2: Examination Revaluation**

**Condition A (Decision Only):**
```
Grievance Status: REJECTED

Your revaluation request has been rejected.
```

**Condition B (Decision + Explanation):**
```
Grievance Status: REJECTED

Your revaluation request has been rejected.

Explanation:
- Applicable Regulation: UGC Examination Guidelines 2018, Section 7.3
- Requirement: Revaluation requests must be submitted within 15 days of result 
  declaration
- Result Declaration Date: January 10, 2024
- Your Submission Date: January 27, 2024
- Days Elapsed: 17 days
- Decision Rationale: Submission deadline exceeded by 2 days

Regulatory Authority: L1 (National - UGC)
Rule Salience: 1800 (High Priority)
```

### Survey Instrument

After viewing each condition, participants rate on **5-point Likert scale** (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree):

**Dependent Variables:**

1. **Perceived Fairness**
   - "The decision feels fair to me."
   
2. **Trust in Institution**
   - "I trust that the institution made this decision correctly."
   
3. **Transparency**
   - "I understand why this decision was made."

**Open-ended Question:**
- "Briefly explain how this decision made you feel and why."

### Data Collection Protocol

1. Participant reads consent form and demographic questionnaire
2. Participant views Condition A or B (counterbalanced)
3. Participant completes 3 Likert ratings + open-ended response
4. 5-minute break with unrelated task (to reduce carryover)
5. Participant views other condition (B or A)
6. Participant completes 3 Likert ratings + open-ended response
7. Debrief and thank participant

### Ethical Considerations

- IRB approval obtained (simulated study)
- Informed consent collected
- Participants informed that scenarios are hypothetical
- No deception used
- Participants can withdraw at any time
- Data anonymized before analysis

### Statistical Analysis Plan

**Primary Analysis:**
- Paired t-tests comparing Condition A vs. Condition B for each dependent variable
- Cohen's d for effect size
- α = 0.05 (two-tailed)

**Hypotheses:**
- H1: Condition B (with explanation) will have higher fairness ratings than Condition A
- H2: Condition B will have higher trust ratings than Condition A
- H3: Condition B will have higher transparency ratings than Condition A

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Thematic coding of open-ended responses
- Identify common themes related to explanation utility
